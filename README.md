# The-Great-clone-of-Patatap

This project creates circle animations randomly on the page, with the help of HTML5 Canvas, and is followed by random sounds, provided by the sounds folder of this project. To use this project, press any of the keys with a letter on it. Does not work with the numbers, space, or any other keys. The libraries used are Paper.js for providing awesome animations and Howler.js for the sounds.
